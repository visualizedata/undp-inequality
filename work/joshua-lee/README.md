# Does Good Governance Reduce Inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa?

#### Description
This visualization compares good governance in Sub-Saharan African countries with their level of inequality. It aims to identify correlations between the two, e.g. does better control of corruption affect inequality? The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) used here measure six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, politically stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.

#### Research Question
I am studying good governance in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because I want to find out more about the relationship between good governance and inequality. I am using indicators from the Worldwide Governance Indicators as to see if the factors affecting good governance have any impact on inequality. My visualization compares good governance in Sub-Saharan African countries with their level of inequality to see if a pattern exists.

## Data Review
## 1
**Selected governance indicators for Africa, 2000 and 2012**

A side by side chart that compares how the five main regions in Africa perform against each other on selected governance indicators in 2000 and 2012. The indicators include control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and vice and accountability. Each indicator score ranges from -2.5 to 2.5 with the highest score being the best. At a glance, Southern and West Africa perform much more poorly on these indicators compared to North, East, and Central Africa.

**Sectoral breakdown of economic activity in Africa, 1990, 2000 and 2010-2012**

The table shows the breakdown of economic activity (as percentage of GDP) in the five main regions of Africa in 1990, 2000, and 2010-2012. The breakdown includes manufacturing, services, agriculture, and industry.

Questions
- How did other developing countries get out of poverty and restructure their economy to a more highly-skilled one?

**Table 5: Enrolment rates in Africa, 2011**

The table shows the enrolment rates for pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary education in Africa in 2011. At a glance the percentage of people entering tertiary education is extremely low, ranging from 6.88% to 23.03%.

Supplemental Sources
- Median net enrolment rates – the gap between SSA and the rest of the world, 2012
- A bar chart that shows the gap of median enrolment rates of primary and secondary education in SSA in 2012 against the rest of the world. At a glance, the gap between SSA and the rest of the world is lower.

Questions
- How have other countries reformed their education to get out of poverty?
